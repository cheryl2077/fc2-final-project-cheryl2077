        "\n",
        "This project explores how stocks are related to each other based on historical price movements, and whether those relationships form natural groups. I measure similarity between stocks using log-return correlations, then construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to keep only the strongest connections. By cutting weak links in the MST, I form clusters of stocks that move closely together. Finally, I visualize both the network structure and the time-series behavior of each cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Finance Background**:\n",
        "Stocks often move together because they are influenced by similar economic forces, such as sector exposure or shared risk factors. Correlation measures how closely two stocks move together over time. An MST simplifies a dense correlation network by keeping only the most important relationships, making the overall structure easier to interpret. Cutting weak connections in the MST helps reveal groups of stocks with stronger internal relationships."
