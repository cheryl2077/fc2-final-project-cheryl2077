        "Stocks often move together because they are affected by similar economic forces. Correlation is a standard way to measure how closely two stocks move. Higher correlation means two stocks tend to rise and fall together; lower correlation means they behave more independently.\n",

        "An MST helps simplify a dense correlation network by keeping only the most important relationships. Cutting weaker links in the MST allows us to identify groups of stocks that are more closely related, which often correspond to common sectors, themes, or shared risk exposures."
