        "This project explores how stocks are related to each other and whether those relationships form natural groups. I measure the similarity between stocks using basic statistical tools (correlation and covariance), build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to keep only the closest connections, then “cut” the weak links to create clusters. Finally, I visualize the network structure and show how stocks inside the same cluster move together over time."
